<h2>How to Change Font in a Div in HTML [Internal CSS]</h2>

<div id="example">This is dummy text. This is more dummy text. This is smaller text.This is more dummy text. This is more dummy text. This is more dummy text. This is more dummy text. This is more dummy text.</div>

<h3>The Explanation</h3>
<p>Iâ€™m using the CodePen Editor so the default font-type, size, and color is Times New Roman, 16px, and black. To change all these properties of a section of text, I could wrap the text in a div and add an ID attribute to the element. Then, I can use an ID selector and set the font-family, font-size, and font-color properties in the head section of the page.
